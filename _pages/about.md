I am a first-year PhD student at Imperial College, supervised by [Azalea Raad](https://soundandcomplete.org) and [Nicolas Wu](https://zenzike.com). Before coming to Imperial, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham.

# Research interests

I am generally interested in programming language theory - the theory that underlies the logical/mathematical foundations of programming languages. More specifically, my research interests include separation logic, algebraic effects and differentiable probabilistic programming languages. I am also interested in category theory and its applications in programming language semantics.
